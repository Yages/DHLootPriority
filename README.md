An addon designed to handle your guild's EPGP standings by storing the respective values in your Officer Notes. Another primary function of the addon is to handle loot moderation which you must be the master looter to utilise.

For this addon to work, anyone using the addon must be able to at the very least view Officer Notes. To adjust EP and GP values you must be able to edit Officer Notes.

The addon is entirely GUI based and the frame is designed to only appear automatically on raid bosses.

## Functionality

* Either /cepgp or /cep can be used as a valid command call
* show - Shows the cepgp window
* version - Allows you to check if each raid member is running the addon - and if so, what version of the addon they are using

**Note: cepgp is a context sensitive addon and elements will be visible when they are relevent**
